# Studying
A repo to practice coding algorithms, data structures, and other fun cs stuff!

The purpose of this repo is to stay fresh on college projects, keeping popular efficient data structures and algorithms fresh in mind.
The hope is that with these memorized and mastered, harder programming questions in the future will be easier.
